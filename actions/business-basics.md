# Business basics

**There is a course that is never taught in business schools, universities or even when we join a company, it’s how to behave in basic business situations and how the foundations of any organization should be built.**  

## **Be explicit**

We tend to overestimate the power of implicit behaviours and underestimate the value of explicit rules. It’s one the most common and devastating flaw that feeds wrongful behaviours in collaborative environment.

The most simple example is the onboarding of new employees. In most companies, they receive a couple of guidelines on their first days, meet up with a bunch of people in their direct and indirect circles of actions and from there are asked to accommodate themselves and find their way through the organisation. It’s like the [gamebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook), but in real life. The output from such a misguided welcoming process is variable and uncertain, which is the opposite effect of what anyone with a basic sense of cohesion would like to achieve.

A normal company would make sure to accommodate its new employees with a clear user guide, compelling and personal profiles \(through a myers briggs test for instance\) about the people they will be working with and a no bullshit presentation about the of vision, focus and value of the company. Unfortunately, it’s rarely the case. The reason for this mistake is the predominance of implicit behaviour over explicit rules in the rest of our relationships. People send signals instead of stating facts, they play roles they fancy instead of finding the one that fits with their psyche, they deploy defence mechanism through ambiguous behaviour instead of showing their true and vulnerable face to their peers. They mimic this attitude in their professional environment and vice versa.

The truth is that what is implicit is by nature unclear and open to interpretation which naturally leads to misunderstanding and ultimately to breaking everything in the pyramid that allows great teams to function: trust, constructive arguments, commitment, accountability and alignment towards results. On the contrary, explicit rules drive the transmitter to clearly express her thoughts, expectations and guidelines while it requires from the receiver to clearly express her understanding, need for clarification or disagreement. Implicit rules only work in one to one interactions in which people understand each other perfectly and know when to be explicit.

With explicit behaviours come the power to disagree and say no.

#### **In practice**

1. One way to avoid as much as possible anything that is implicit and/or could me misinterpreted is to write down things, whether we talk about the action plan following a meeting or even a feedback regarding a person. 
2. It is not because we are explicit that people necessarily understand or agree with our comments. As a rule of thumb, we shall apply robust logic in thinking and writing. In order to do that, I advise you to read The Pyramid Principle from Barbara Minto. 
3. Explicit communication goes both ways, do not hesitate to ask someone for clarification or to repeat what someone has said to make sure that you’re synchronized on the form and substance.

## **Default no**

At school, quick consensus and compromises always won over arguments in order to avoid disorder and distractions. At home, no was associated to a word used by parents unilaterally towards their children but at the same time it was not the expected answer to requests formulated from grown-ups to their kids. We live in a society where saying yes is associated to positivity and no to negativity, while truly it’s simply a deliberate and most of the time authorized choice between moving forward or staying steal, triggering following consequences.

Let’s face it, each one of us has been or is struggling with it, we let ourselves trapped into the trivial good and bad short-sighted approach of saying no. We tend to delay rather than pass or make the time for something. We find excuses instead of telling the truth. We argue lacking time while doing nothing in the meantime. We let go things hoping that they will vanish overtime instead of replying with a frank answer. We say yes to attend useless or unproductive meetings rather than politely declining or formatting those meetings so that they can be useful. We fake good reasons to cancel commitments instead of just saying that we are not up to it because we prefer to do something else instead. We pretend the bus was late instead of admitting we overslept, and this list goes on and on...

The issue with this behaviour of avoiding a clear no is not only that we don’t frankly say what we have in mind, letting ourselves express our feelings, it’s that we pile up false, pending or junk decisions and actions. We misguide ourselves, annihilate our freedom and ability to make a deliberate choice at a time when we can. Finally, we impose ourselves with the double penalties of finding excuses because we feel guilty to say no and feeling bad because we know that we are not being honest… it’s a painful paradox that we carry on our shoulders every single day.

As from today, free yourself from that stupid burden, because saying no is actually great. It means that you are in control again. It allows you to stay focus on a clean path instead of bumping into obstructing objects on the way that you take as obligations at worst, and cover with excuses at best. It also protects your environment from the bad choices you might make.

However, saying no is always taken as a rejection, therefore you need to soften the impression that will last from the interaction. It’s all about finding honest positivity in the way you say it. Use soft words such as “unfortunately”, or “let’s agree with disagree here but…” or a simple “sorry” or a smiley. It’s about delivering the message so that people don’t take it too personally. Also, and this is not a minor parameter, a proper no is always quickly delivered, you should not let too much time pass between a request or a question and your negative answer to it, people will value your reactivity before all. That’s how I deal with saying no to entrepreneur a dozen time every single day, they usually thank me for the prompt answer while many people in my industry tend to wait too long or don’t even answer.

Say no, say it fast, say it nicely.

#### **In practice**

1. Start by delivering quick answers to people with honest positivity. Everytime you are about to say no to a request, do not wait, do it right away. If you feel uncertain, just say it, so that people don’t misinterpret your uncertainty. 
2. A no will always trigger a displeasing emotion, but reasons usually trigger bad feelings as it makes it more personal. Everytime you deliver a negative answer, be brief, don’t no emphasize too much around it because people at best will try to argue with you, probably in a nice way, but at worst it will give them all the reason of the world not to like you. 
3. A no can be a final answer but it can also be temporary or based on current facts. Do not hesitate to mention clearly if you expect to consider this matter another time or through different conditions or not.

## **Keep growing up**

The more you gain responsibilities and progress in your professional life and the more you need to improve and control your organisation as more and more opportunities and duties are coming your way, attached to the functions of not only doing things, but also managing projects and potentially leading people.

It doesn’t hit us as an obvious necessity to optimize our agenda during the early days of our career. We are full of energy, the constraints of our personal life are limited and we are focused on making a great impression by working hard and late to move up the ladder. We don’t realize the dangerous limits of pushing ourselves beyond capacity, it feels like our full power gauge will never run out of electricity. The truth is that we eventually discover that we all reach our limits and that we pile up bad habits by pushing too hard instead of mastering our perimeter of actions.

On top of having more things to do, more emails to answer, more interactions to deal with, we cope with more opportunities to filter and more teamwork to handle through collaboration, management and leadership. As the field of responsibilities and possibilities is growing larger, we shall not fall behind our zone of competency and quality work. Therefore we must improve our productivity and overall management of all things, whether we talk about execution, management or leadership.

Execution is both about making choices and delivering in time and quality. Put yourself in a [growth mindset](http://amzn.eu/d/7yufOkF), where you never settle before productivity and achievements. We are always in an ongoing process of learnings and improvements. Take the necessary step to learn from others and find the right resources that will help you thrive as an engaged and performing individual. We shall never feel \(or just temporarily\) overwhelmed by the quantity of work that lies ahead of us.

Regarding management and collaboration, we can’t allow ourselves to be either under or over delegating and managing, we absolutely must find the right balance between trusting our collaborators enough and yet setting the necessary checkpoints and principles for the team to achieve with guidance and confidence. Remember the importance of explicit communication.

Finally, when it comes to leadership but also to opening ourselves to opportunities, it’s important that we don’t lose ourselves in appearances, ego-driven decisions and the false impressions that looking good, inspiring and dominating prevail on authenticity, open-mindedness and respect. Opportunities must be filtered through our framework. As for leadership, it is about showing the way with confidence, empowering the people that will become our proxies on the field and being an example for them.

#### In practice

1. As time passes, we usually have more and more things to do. Time is a finite and we are the master on how we organize it. Beside organizing your agenda in order to be productive, grow up as well by learning and filtering opportunities accordingly. 
2. We always fall short at some point in our organisation or way of doing things, out of our competency zone. It’s just because we must learn and grow-up. Take the necessary time and steps to get out of this red zone by learning from your mistakes and what you understand you don’t know. 
3. We can’t master everything, as you grow up, do not try to master absolutely everything. Some things should not fall into our zone of actions and should be delegated, learn to find ways into working at what you do best and on the other way around. We must temper our weaknesses and emphasize our strengths.

## **Dealing with opportunities**

Opportunities grow within our field of duties and sollicitations. But we can't accept them all and as time goes by, we must filter them out through the right choice-making framework.

Note that they can either be necessary, opportunistic or wanted. Sometimes all three. For every opportunity that comes our way, we must figure out whether it fits or not within our personal or professional agenda, its immediate and foreseeable benefits or potentials as well as its current and future power or influence.

To avoid any confusion, note that an agenda has nothing to do with being purely transactional or too much ego driven in the way we assess sollicitations and opportunities. Those are two traps that many people tend to fall into. It's about knowing what we are looking for as a professional as much as a human being, and it should be balanced between pleasure, responsibilities and simple open-mindedness. For instance, the pleasure to connect with genuine individual is part of our personal journey, the will to meet with people from new industries to open ourselves to new perspectives can be part of our professional one.

Benefits or potentials follow the same path as we are either receiving, providing or sharing when going through those opportunities. Receiving is a benefit that we take from an interaction like asking a friend to connect us with someone in their network. Providing is our ability to give whether the favor will be returned or not in the future, it’s what people call nurturing their karma or taking a pay-it-forward action, like helping someone in their search for a job. Sharing is when parties benefit both from the same interaction, the most obvious example is sharing a moment with a friend. Those benefits must be driven by both purpose, generosity and need for achievement, of course not on an equal basis but with a fair dose for each of those attributes.

Power and influence are subtle yet fundamental notions, that mixed up with our flattered ego, can tend to blind us. Every time we are solicited by or in an interaction with someone, we tend to assess her social value whether it is immediately visible or in a foreseeable future. We are naturally attracted by people who follow a path of success or have already succeeded in the past. It is not a shocking truth, it is a trait that we must both acknowledge and accept. However, we should control this behaviour first by learning to assess and detect early on the people who have the attributes to succeed in a near future and with whom we would like to build a trustful relationship and second we shall never be blinded by the aura of a person just because she is successful. The best relationships are honest, caring and authentic.

Exceptionally, we sometimes must accept opportunities and sollicitations from people we don’t value the characters but that we know could be useful or because it’s in our duties, that’s how politics work for instance. At the same time, we shall take more casual opportunities, knowing that most of them will often end-up nowhere but also that extraordinary encounters can come from them, that is how I got to meet with one of the best entrepreneur I know and who is nowadays a true friend. Don’t assess opportunities like a bag of random candies, cherry pick the best, avoid the bestsellers if you don’t like them and try a couple a new ones. Diversity always wins.

#### **In practice**

1. Whether or not you have a lot of opportunities, you shall assess them, at least to get a sense of understanding in the way you’re dealing with them naturally. 
2. Opportunities are complex, we must therefore assess them through an inductive way, all four factors at the same time and not one after the other. 
3. Opportunities are tightly linked to the time we make for them, make sure that both fit. If you happen to have time, take more of them. If you’re running behind your agenda, take less, opportunities are an easy variables to adjust.

## **Decision and action principles**

The word “decision” comes from old french decider from latin decidere that literally means “to cut off," from de- "off" \(see de-\) + caedere "to cut". That tells a lot about the function of taking decisions and actions. We talked about the crucial importance of mastering our agenda, making deliberate and thoughtful choices, and overall keeping our head clear of everything that unnecessarily keep our mind busy and prevent us to see clearly. Making decisions and moving forward is one very important piece of the puzzle as it doesn’t only drive operational but also strategic moves, with the right velocity.

Whatever comes to your mind, you need to put it somewhere, whether it’s in the bin, in a list or just in action immediately. Every decision or action you’ll have to take is composed of four elements: Substance, Intensity, Impact, Reversibility.  


![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bIxljFq_hFiTUvEWTZH3CfwW1w7gQx6PYWZjb4Q9BFeJ3xNnJPW9wdWBr-T1KJBjuaEdu4GSuuVrlf8b0Qj4Wn3mb98YGBbjYN_IlSCXF7EHTcT9bjHJDEvGZH4K_nRXMDLlkGgL)

The substance of a decision is how much information we have about something in order to decide. Sometimes we have enough, most of the time we don’t. But in any case, it should not prevent us to move forward if we believe to have enough because the necessary effort for a marginal gain of substance is rarely worth it, first because if the information wasn’t previously available to us it probably means that it wasn’t available to others who would have had to take this same decision and secondly because while moving forward we will access new and more information that will affect the course of the events, therefore making some of the previous information less important if not irrelevant. That’s why we should just make sure that we have accessed to most part of the available substance in order to make a move, to take a decision.

Whatever the action we are about to perform, we must think about its impact. It’s of high importance in business to measure not only the intensity of a decision but where it can lead us. If you are saying something bad in public about a competitor for instance, even though the intensity is very low, the impact is potentially high as it could unleash a lot more than a simple reaction from them. When you are creating a new business unit within a company, it’s not how much effort that you are putting into it that only counts, it’s what you can get from it compared to the current perimeter of your business and the long term strategy that you are envisioning for the future. Looking at the impact first can sometimes help you decide whether you should look into the intensity of moving forward or if it’s not even worth it.

The intensity of a decision is how much effort is required to perform an action. Saying no to a solicitation has no intensity whatsoever while developing a new business unit within a company is of high intensity. Whenever you experience a situation where the magnitude of what’s necessary to move forward seems really high, look how you can slice it into pieces in order to clearly see it and potentially better handle it. We don’t eat a whole pizza, we cut it. It looks the same but it is tranched and at least we can put it in our mouth and stop whenever we are not hungry anymore. The same apply to decisions. our mind can’t correctly perform what can’t be clearly envisioned. Furthermore, it allows us to measure quick progress and adapt in all situations instead of going all the way through in a wrong direction and potentially end up stuck in front of a wall that now seems impossible to jump across.

Substance, intensity and impact are worth nothing without the assessment of reversibility. It’s subtle and yet of the higher importance to reflect on the potential reversibility of a decision. We have all realized when arguing with someone how hard it was to take back words we wish we wouldn’t have said. It was of low intensity, it did impact the person but moreover it was irreversible, it’s just repairable. On the contrary, launching a new business unit can be of high intensity but it’s reversible and sometimes with very limited impacts.

Once you’ve acknowledged the composition of the decision making process, you need to put it into actions, figure out how to move forward. Assess substance, impact, intensity and reversibility in this order. For every parameter there is an action to perform.

#### In practice

1. If you have enough substance, you move towards assessing the impact. If you don’t have enough substance in your opinion, you identify who and how you could get enough in a relatively short period of time, it’s all about not breaking the equilibrium between efforts and benefits. 
2. Once you have enough substance, you check the impact of an action. If the impact is too low, you must ask yourself if it’s worth it, and then move to the intensity required to perform the action. If the intensity is high while the impact is low, it’s probably a mistake, you should not do it. 
3. If the intensity of an action is important and the impact is potentially important as well, you must move forward if it’s something for which you have the authority, otherwise, you shall ask your superior in order to decide whether or not it’s a priority as it will require resources. If the intensity is low on the contrary, just move to the bottom of the ladder and assess the reversibility. 
4. Either it’s in your responsibilities and then move forward or it is not and you must ask, it’s like in a restaurant, a waiter can’t offer a coffee to a customer unless the owner authorizes him to do so, otherwise he must ask for permission. And that’s why it’s important to assess the substance, impact and intensity first in order to defend your case towards the person in charge of making the final call.



## **Meeting Dilemma**

When it comes to team and organisation, we usually face the time killing power of attending meetings. I’m not saying that meetings are a complete waste of time, but they shall definitely be organised in regards to the reason of their existence.

Meetings can be defined as people getting together in order to exchange as active participants, on a specific matter. An active participant is someone who needs to attend the meeting because her input, during the event, matter to reach the goals defined in the agenda. A passive participant, on the contrary, is a person who shouldn’t need to attend a meeting whether or not she’s implicated in the matter, as long as she can access its synthetic minutes afterwards. In some of our portfolio companies, passive participants are tagged in the minutes of meetings they didn’t need to attend. It allows them to stay in the loop of something that is in a close or within an area of what they are doing, while avoiding distraction. Be careful not to mix up the two attributes, someone can be passive and still have an opinion to share in the minutes of the meetings, that doesn’t mean the person needed to attend.

#### Seven

As said in the chapter “clear up your mind”, beyond seven items, our memory struggles and our mind loses clairvoyance. This number can also be applied in teamwork. It’s proven that a team loses efficiency if there are more than seven people including the manager, it is also true in meetings. Meetings rooms should be limited to seven seats maximum.

Sometimes people organize meetings mostly to report and answer questions, not to collaborate really. At best, people listen a long discourse, at worst they don’t even make the effort to listen to a boring teller. One to many interactions shouldn’t require meetings, on the contrary, it should be asked to the speaker to send a short vocal or written note with a support if needed, and from there people could comment and ask questions. It allows an asynchronous flow or information that will better fit with everyone’s agenda and on top of that it forces the speaker to keep her demonstration short while keeping a record for everyone of everything that is said about a given subject.

#### Organisation

This being said, meetings must sometimes be organized either to talk about opportunities \(open sessions\) or work on a ongoing project \(collaborative sessions\). In those two cases, here are the requirements to successfully run them.

People must be respectful. The first rule to respect is not to use a phone or a laptop during a gathering, it should be forbidden, it’s a lack of respect and a clear sign of disengagement. People are allowed to have a piece of paper and a pen. The only person authorised to have a laptop is the one recording the minutes.

The second rule is to respect people’s time. Meetings start on time and the people who come late are not authorized to join after 5 minutes. If some companies do it what couldn’t you? In some venture capital firms, the partners must put ten dollars in a charity pot per minute for being late. It’s a strict rule that forces good behaviour within the organisation. I would advise that every person who is late, besides being kicked out, must be annotated in the minutes. Accountability matters.

The third rule is to force a timing policy where before each meeting, we agree on the time that is  necessary to cover the subject. Have a default duration of 30 minutes instead of 1 hour, and take it from there. Time must be a constraints when it comes to business meetings, not a recreation. It must certainly feel pressuring at the beginning, but it’s no more than a rule and just like some people tend to be more efficient than others, time-constrained meetings invite people to structure their thoughts in order to get things done in time and in order. Try it out within your organisation. Some people won’t like it at first, but they will end up understand its value afterwards. One way to deal with cutting in half your meetings is to limit the speaking time per person, let’s say two minutes per individual on any given subject for instance.

Now about the core principles to successfully run meetings. It’s about setting the goal, the participants and the actions:

We shall never accept nor get into a meeting without a clear purpose, it’s complicated enough to have people collaborate together at once. People must understand where we are going to as a group, whether the exact destination is clear or is bound to be figured out along the way. Once a goal is set, one must add participants.

We must only add active participants and make sure that the passive ones can access the minutes of the meeting afterwards. The specialty in large organisations is to have meetings with two many participants in which half of the people do not necessarily need to be here but have been invited and attend in order to protect their ego. Ego must be used as a driver and an enabler, not a blocker or destroyer. A participant must be assigned the task to take the minutes of the meetings. This person is in charge afterwards to dispatch everyone’s actions with clear objective and timing to both active and passive participants.  


Small actions and short timing always win over large assignments and extended deadlines. At any moment, think of ways to simplify your work by cutting it in smaller pieces.  


![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

#### Politics

I understand that in large organisation where egos rule the group dynamics, we often face the obligation to invite people who would otherwise feel left aside or bypassed. But remember that you have the choice to be in control of the meetings you’ve scheduled and it’s your responsibility to become an example for others, to show them that ruling meetings differently means that you are after efficiency and not useless courtoisy. Stop making excuses and apologizing, it’s your role to explain people why and how the things that you do are organized in a certain way.  


#### In practice

1. Invite people to work asynchronously to maximize efficiency. Meetings should be limited in numbers, time and participants. The active ones should be prevent, the passive ones should be focusing on something else and access to the minutes afterwards. 
2. A meeting is the composition of a clear agenda, a list of relevant participants and dispatched actions after the meetings with clear items and timing associated to them. 
3. Do not let politics or disorganized people rule the world around you. Besides emergency, make sure that you help the organisation thrive through better practices, even though it’s difficult and painful at the beginning.

**Key Takeaways:** In business, simple rules always apply if we want to make a great use of our time and get the most out of our actions. We must first and foremost make sure to build the most comprehensive bridge of communication with people by being explicit in the way we express our feelings and decisions. From there we must learn to say no and drive our own path of achievements and growth by dealing with opportunities and duties, by learning how to take actions and decisions the right way, as well as by organizing our interactions with people in efficient meetings.
