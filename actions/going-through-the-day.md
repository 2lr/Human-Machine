# Going through the day

## Perimeter of time and actions

The agenda is a mechanical way to regain control over the events. It’s way too difficult to acknowledge our fundamental need to accept our imperfections and vulnerability, to simply become another person that knows when to accept, decline or comment decisions and actions, to be genuinely responsible of how we organize our day. It requires too much effort at once to change gears and we all know that those kind of heavy moves never really work.

That is why we must take action through small steps and define automatic ways to achieve a better balance in how we manage our life and our days. What you don’t realize yet is that the more you take control of the events of your life and the more it spreads to others, attracting more opportunities, talents and serendipity in general. People who manage their life well magnetize attention as they appear to be able to achieve so much more in so little time.

In reality, it’s just that they are in control of their perimeter of time and actions. If you ask them, they will be able to tell you explicitly why and how their agenda is organized in a certain way, whether it’s implicit through a natural order that they manage to keep or explicit through clear rules that they respect as much as possible.

You’re not an exception. If you want to gain a better control over your life, you need to build a perimeter of time and actions.

Your agenda is a perimeter that contains minutes. And it’s divided in three areas: work, private and intimate. Each of those boxes have two conditions: how much time you put into them and what constraints do they have.

Let’s start with the private box, it’s the most simple one, this is the time you pass with your friends. Define how many get together you would like to organize or go to in a given week or month. Set rules and constraints like not going out the first three days of the week, not drinking alcohol beside friday and Saturday night or not going to bed after midnight weekdays nights out as much as possible.

As for your intimate box, this is family time. You should always account for 120% of the time you’ve set for this perimeter as you know that you will happen to be late sometimes or might struggle not to make exceptions with some events in your work environment. In my case for instance, I always try to be home by 7.30pm to be with the kids before they go to bed. I shall leave my smartphone aside until 9pm as well.  I try to always respect those conditions and make sure that intimacy always goes before and beyond work and private events when it’s possible.

Let’s get to the work perimeter. It’s usually the part that takes most of our day, that looks endless, full of time and opportunities and that we end up struggling with for no real reason rather than disorganization. First, ask yourself how much time you need, every week to complete your work. Don’t be pessimistic or optimistic, many people manage to achieve a lot of things in very little time, it’s just about deciding how much time you want to pass on those things and you will adjust them afterwards so they can fit within your schedule. Yes, it’s that simple really. For me, it all starts at 9am and ends at 7pm, it’s about 10 hours per day. You add to this two slots of 5 additional hours that I usually put on wednesday and sunday. In total, I work approximately 60 hours a week. When i’m on holidays, I tend to keep roughly 2 hours per day, which account for a total of 15h per week. This is my perimeter of time to action at work. Once you’ve defined yours, whether it’s 30, 50 or 80 hours a week, you must work towards being at 80% capacity at all times. The reason is that unexpected events always occur in professional environments, and they tend to overstep on our private and most importantly intimate life. You need space in your agenda to place those exceptions. In your mind, 80% sounds pretty close to 100%, but it you think about it in absolute value, the number is actually pretty huge. In my 60 hours work week, it accounts for 12 hours which is more than 2 hours per working day to manage exceptions. And i’ll get to that later but for each phase of my day, I also make time for a buffer in case unexpected things happen.

Defining how much time you pass at work and how much time you save for intimacy and private events doesn’t prevent you from overpassing the limits, from accepting unexpected things, from not doing exactly what you’ve planned. It’s not about building a blameless organisation. Lawyers and Investment Bankers for instance are constantly pushed over the boundaries when it comes to deliver their work. But you must put theoretical limits, otherwise you always keep moving with the flow without developing a sense of where you stand in the perimeter that you have defined.

You lose sight and control of your agenda and therefore on your life.

#### In practice

1. Identify your zones of constraints and duties, whether they are deliberate or forced, in regards with your family or your work environment. Mark them on your agenda in order to design the theoretical boundaries of your professional, private and intimate periods. Starting to work at 8.30, home by 7.30pm, inbox-zero time starting every wednesday at 10pm and sunday at 6pm for instance. Don’t forget to move incrementally by applying those constraints partially at first in order to get accustomed to them. 
2. Depending on your preferences, needs & requirements, put strict rules in order to find a certain health balance, in terms of sleep, nights-out, food, quiet times. For instance, no screen after 11pm, no alcohol during the week, no meat at dinner, home by 7.30pm, no phone between 8pm and 9pm. Put those rules in a list, start with one, be consistent about it and then apply a new one. 
3. Make sure that you don’t feel frustrated or guilty whenever a rule isn’t perfectly set or applied, remember that you’re in an unstable and imperfect equilibrium, this perimeter is bound to provide you with serenity and a sense of control, not with rules that feel like a burden to carry.

## **Work phases**

Once we have determined how much time we approximately want to dedicate to each part of our life, we must organize our work day to reach a certain level of accomplishment. The best way to do that is to divide it in three phases: productive, interactive and inductive slots, each one of them having its own function.

The productive phase is basically when it’s yourself against time and actions, this moment when you need to reply emails, write a report, prepare something. For me it’s going down my inbox, my todo list, the dealflow. It’s a time when you need to concentrate to maximise your productivity. We are prone to distraction, whether we talk about notifications or solicitations from others. Besides meditation that can help you get prepared for this phase, don’t let external elements disturb you in what you are doing, it is essential to understand that most things, even the apparently urgent ones, can wait minutes if not hours. It’s not a question of life and death. You must push your environment to be more patient and to foresee their sollicitation. You’re certainly at their service, but just not whenever they want. And if anything critical shall surface, analyze when and how it should reach to you. For instance, thanks to ifttt.com you can trigger notifications in case of specific recipient or keywords in an email. Let your colleagues know when not to disturb you. At the office, my notifications on my mac are always off, on my phone as well and only my wife and my boss are in favorites in order for me to receive their texts, emails and calls at any moment during the day. The rest of the time, my phone is in night mode, which allows it to receive notifications without turning on the screen. Once every 45 minutes, I look at the screen, see if there is any emergency and then go back to work. This productive phase should happen when you are the most alert, for me it’s in the morning and it can last up to 3 hours, after that i’m less efficient, less focused and need to get into another phase.

The interactive phase is when you meet with people. There are three kinds of interactions with them: open discussions, opportunities and collaborations.

Open discussions are when you meet with colleagues over lunch or coffee and discuss various matters without no specific agendas. You should not get rid of those get together because you never know what can come from those interactions even though some of them appear to be unproductive. However, you shall limit their duration otherwise people always find a way to keep the conversation going. Those talks should come after intensive productive phases \(during lunch for instance\) or between long meetings, the lack of pressure put your mind at ease during those moments.

Before or during lunch for instance, I often go talk with the team about various matters, asking questions about certain events, figuring out how they feel about a person or a deal, telling them about things I have found especially exciting.  

Opportunities are when the conversation topic requires attention through reflection, it puts your system 2 to a real test so you can’t afford to have those meetings after a long day or when your mind is preoccupied, try to have those discussions when you are the most assertive.

It's when you meet with a new client who is expressing specific needs, when you’re discussing about something important with someone that you have not totally figured out yet, when you must make a great first impression.

Finally, the collaborative interactions are when you work on something you know well, something for which you don’t need to put too much of an effort into your system 2 to make it work. It's discussing about the progress on a project or a task for instance.

Interactive phases can’t last too long as they require attention about the situation, what other people say, how to react… Make sure you plan a buffer between those events, could be 10 or 15 minutes, just to go over your emails and other notifications, see if everything is running smoothly before jumping into the next interaction. Pause for a minute, breathe, have a glass of water, walk around the room, get ready for the next meeting. It is proved that between two intensive tasks, people who had a real break tend to over-perform those who didn’t.

Between interactive and productive periods lies inductive phases, moments during which you don’t produce anything, you don’t interact with anyone, you are just in reading mode, looking at information, analyzing situations, reflecting. It’s a moment when you put your mind at ease, it’s a way to let the pressure down and open yourself to reflection, like when you walk in nature and thoughts naturally come to you, in a clear, simple, obvious way. Inductive phases are important as they either precede or follow more intensive moments. Keep a notebook close by in order to write down thoughts and learnings as they come without taking the risk of losing them. They are very important moments to find balance in your activities. It’s like reading before sleeping instead of watching tv series, walking without your phone instead of checking social media feeds, listening to someone without speaking or having an intention to reply. It’s an automatic, natural control valve.

Either around lunch after a long day, I take 30 minutes to an hour to think, read, rest with no attention of pulling off something useful or productive, to me it's a state of active meditation.

You must figure out the best moments of your day for each of those phases and make sure that you successfully organize your agenda around them. For instance, i take no meetings in the morning, start my meetings at 2pm in the afternoon with a last one at 5pm. I tend to always have about thirty minutes before lunch and one hour before going back home in the evening for my inductive phase or clean-up pending tasks. This is how my agenda is organized on a daily basis. Also, i take no meetings on wednesday in order to leave room for last minute appointments or important things to do.

#### In practice

1. Define your needs in terms of production, interaction and induction. Adapt those slots in regards with your work parameter \(60 hours for me per week\), your constraints and preferences. ****
2. Start by locking-up the interactive slots and see how it goes from there. We often book too many meetings that are either not so useful or too long. It’s a great self-restraining exercice and a way to put to the test your ability to control your environment. From there you can put around the productive and inductive phases. 
3. Be careful not to deport the problem by extending the due dates of tasks or putting meetings like three weeks ahead. I do not book meetings beyond two weeks, it’s a way for me to make sure that I am always in control. Do the same if you can.

## Getting there: Commit and fix limits

You’ve probably decided to put in practice some of the past advices but here is the thing… Your restraining-self is telling you that it’s far more easily said than done. I know this feeling, i’ve been there myself, thinking that i couldn’t force my environment to adapt to my agenda or my rules and that many things were preventing me to do so. Believe me, everything that helped me structure my organisation also contributed to increase the quality of my relationships, of my work, of my life in general. I told you before and i must insist on that, people value positive honesty, that’s what matters most. So, stop making excuses.

People never yelled at me for saying no to an investment opportunity, on the contrary they value my quick, polite decisions, even though it’s short and direct. It’s the same when a colleague comes to you for a break and you tell them that you are not available and prefer to concentrate on your two hours work slot. They won’t really appreciate your honesty at first, but they will definitely understand it if you explain it to them clearly, with a genuine smile. If someone is asking you something but you are already onto another task, it’s ok to answer that you’ll do it later as you are focused on something else. People need to be heard and understood, they need to trust that what they’re asking is processed, correctly and on time. That’s it. Positive honesty.

You’re not going to change your entire agenda right away, that will never work, the change would be too brutal, you have to take small steps and secure each one of them before taking another. The easier step that people can do is when they are already in control. During the productive phase, try to put your phone in night mode and mute all notifications. Block two or three slots during the week, of two to three hours here and there during which you won’t take any meetings. You’ll expand those phases later on when you’ll feel comfortable. Also block a couple of slots of thirty minutes each to do nothing. Read or think, nothing else, and certainly no screens, you’ll get back to your old habits too quickly otherwise. You might be tempted to keep your notifications on or your phone not too far away from you. Don’t, otherwise you will never understand the value of staying off the grid, you won’t realize that things keep running even when you’re not around for an hour.

As for your intimate life, be home early two times a week as a start and expand from there. Just make moves, small ones, incrementally. They must feel good, fulfilling, you must feel that you are in control again. If this is not what you feel, stop what you are doing, try something else until it ends up working. There are dozens of potential moves so don’t get stuck in one that doesn’t feel right to you. Once it’s working, block those slots in your agenda or make sure they become habits. It takes roughly 60 days to build a habit and only a couple of weeks to kill it.

You also must remember the difference between time control and action control. Time control is how much time you dedicate to something while action control is what need to be done regardless how much time you pass on it. You can either work on a presentation for a certain period of time and get back to it another time or decide to work until to reach the completion of an action. You should always fix limits to control your environment. In the past, I was replying with long form text when I was saying no to an opportunity, now it’s only one sentence, because that’s how I manage to deal with so much dealflow. My meetings with entrepreneurs used to last one hour. I figured that it was probably too much and that 30 minutes meetings were largely enough for us to have a first good interaction. You’re the master of time, and time is the master of your productivity, so save it and use it wisely.

This structure of organisation would be useless without putting into it some business basics. This is what the next chapter is about :\)

#### In practice

1. Start small, lock habits and grow from there. It’s ok to aim not too high at first. You need the satisfaction of having succeeded to find the courage to keep moving forward. Motivation comes from shocks or past successes, it doesn’t rise up out of the blue. 
2. Some efforts will feel natural, some others will require that you force yourself into achieving them. It’s only after you successfully run a couple of experiments that you will understand the value of your actions and gain confidence into pushing those efforts forward. 
3. If you can’t feel your progress, then measure them. Record how much time you pass in meetings, reading stories to your kids, reading books. Every checkpoint or achievement can be measured in a way.

**Key Takeaways:** It’s impossible to gain a better control of our agenda without becoming our own master of time and actions. The only way to do that is to set perimeters for our work, private and intimate life. It is composed of rules in terms of time, actions, restrictions. From there we can better organise our agenda and especially our work phases. They can be distinguished in three phases: The productive one that allows us to get things done, the interactive one during which we collaborate and exchange, and the inductive one in order to either reflect or be in reading and listening mode. Those perimeters and phases can’t be designed and developed efficiently overnight, it is critical to take our time when it comes to change the way we go through our days. One step after another, we shall set or adapt our agenda in order to reach a great  level of awareness and control.
