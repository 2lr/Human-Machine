# Long term actions

One of the essence of life is our capacity to project our short term actions in the long term like the notion of time was disappearing into one single perspective of our existence. In an attempt to prepare your mind to this, I didn’t want to go over this subject before in the book. Now i think you might be ready.

In a company, we talk about Vision, Focus and Values. The vision is the long term purpose of the organisation, the focus is the next milestone to reach in order to progress throughout the vision and the values, or behaviours, are the principles through which people perform every action and decision within the organisation.

Some people will tell you it’s Karma. And it is. But just like the notion of habits, it has been overused and it’s now lost in the things that don’t even reach to us as meaningful anymore. To put it into other words, the world is colluding towards the future you are pursuing and all the elements that you’ve been putting together in order to get there. And there are two ways to envision the future, conscious and voluntary or unconscious and involuntary. The former maximizes your chance to reach the best possible output while the latter is like playing a game without understand the goal nor the rules.

There are three things that drive our ability to find the right balance in life. First, you must understand the underlying principles behind success and happiness and this is not an easy task ask you can quickly dive and get lost into the intricacies of too much philosophy and spirituality. Second, you must challenge yourself towards change and growth as this is the only way to reflect on the actions of our life and become the next best version of ourselves. Finally, you need to foster the art of luck and understand the value of the compounded effects of our actions and decisions in life.

## Success & Happiness

This is a tough one as there isn’t a universal recipe towards happiness. However I like to believe that it’s easier than it seems to feel happy and successful. It has really nothing to do with getting into a complex reflection on your life or a deep dive into your past, at least not as a starting point. It’s about nurturing the right attitude.

#### Presence and Enjoyment

There are two ways of dealing with the present moment, it’s either to get through it or find an escape by thinking about a better past, a better future or where the grass is greener. You will find that projections are always disappointing, for a single simple reason: we never really get there. Our imagination has a powerful instant effect but it doesn’t last and only builds up frustration and discomfort if we count on it to drive our life. Just look at the effect of some drugs on people, how devastating it is. Besides the physical addiction, it’s the search for something else than the present moment.

Get rid of the fear of living the moment, don’t look at the past with nostalgia or in the future with hope. It’s not that the past isn’t something great to remember or that the future is not exciting, but it shouldn’t drive your impressions of the present moment. Like anything in life, we always better cope with something that we accept to live with than something that we tend to silent or put aside.

Learn to live the moment and grab the parts that you enjoy, it will mechanically and through hormonal reaction helps your mind simply find peace and happiness.

#### Gratitude and Tolerance

Then come Gratitude and Tolerance. Whenever you live the moment, you will find positive or negative feelings and energies hit you with various magnitude. Someone holding the door for you will make you feel good while someone taking a parking spot right in front of you will probably piss you off.

It’s not that you must hold your feelings in order to have a positive attitude at all time, but you must emphasize the positive actions and feelings of your life to increase the effect in your mind. As for negative impressions and behaviours that drive anger, frustration and negative thoughts, you must activate tolerance in order to calm down your emotions and reflect on a situation. Remember that people with positive honesty always win on the long run.

No one has ever become happy from holding anger, being irritated or feeding negative thoughts.

#### Positivity & Engagement

Once your notions of time and mindset are in place by enjoying the moment and by reflecting as it should be on the things that are happening in your life, you are able to drive positivity and engagement towards success.

Success had nothing to do about how much money you get or everything you own. Success is about finding and trying to maintain a struggle-free fulfilling balance in your life.

Positivity and Engagement are both a cause and a consequence that drive success, positivity being an hormonal driver of performance and engagement a root cause for resilience and therefore achievement. Note that it’s only possible if you have found something in which you thrive and in order to do that, I invite you to get back where we talk about loving what we do well, and not the other way around.  

#### In practice

1. Enjoy the present moment. Don’t hide yourself in the past or project yourself in an imaginary future too often, i will harm your ability to live your present life and be happy. 
2. At any moment you will live positive or negative moments. Emphasize with gratitude the positive aspects of your life without getting into some sort of extreme positivity, aka utopia. Make sure you build tolerance towards the negative aspects of your life in order to temper them. 
3. Finally, keep in mind that a positive and engaged movement always provide better consequences than the opposite. Everything you do should be driven by those two attributes.

## **Criticism & Growth**

One of the worst enemy of human being is misplaced ego. It annihilates everything that allows us to grow, thrive and become a better version of ourselves.

The best example we can think of if this person at the office who turns red whenever she is criticized, tells excuses instead of explaining the reasons of her failures and mistakes, hides herself behind false/made-up things and achievements. These people pass more time lying to themselves and others as well as saving the appearances rather than learning and growing to become a better person. You are maybe this person, maybe not… I would say that two third of the people who are like this and who have been offered this book or have bought it will never go through this chapter anyway while telling people that they have read it and that it was good, or not, or whatever sounds better.

The ego trap is a liability that we must get rid of as much as possible if we want our cerebral cortex to properly work and process information as it should and not as our ego would like it to be. One can’t succeed nor be truly happy without letting her ego aside and grow with clairvoyance and open-mindedness. Take a moment and realize if the following statements are true: I ignore the feedbacks that I don’t like instead of presuming they are true by default. I tend to surround myself with people I can dominate or that I feel comfortable with instead of learning from others and surround myself with people smarter than me. I feel uncomfortable whenever I lose control of something. I talk a lot about what I have done and achieved instead of where I struggle with and need to learn. I wonder more about what people thinks of me than the actual results of my actions. I have talked about things that I have actually failed to do, many times and for which I found a way to save the day.

Don’t ask those questions yourself, ask someone else to be brutally honest with you about whether those statements are partly true or not.

Criticism acceptance and reassessment are what allow us to move forward with a growth mindset and not a fixed one. You can have strong conviction but you should be careful about your certainties, they block everything that come their way to confirm, deny or amend our thinking or what we believed where facts while they only were a mere view of something, from a narrowed perspective.

#### In practice

1. Do not make excuses, you are not perfect in many ways. 
2. Ask people for brutally honest feedbacks. 
3. Own, accept and reflect on criticism.

## **The art of luck & compounded effects**

Is there any such thing as luck? It’s difficult to determine the volatile hazardous nature of something that we struggle to explain through a simple mechanism. However, as we can attest that some people are generally lucky, life’s events find themselves linked to each others in some mysterious ways over the course of actions throughout time and circumstances.

I like to believe that there this is no random nor organized order in the way things are happening. It’s all about maximizing the probability of making great things happen. If you stay home, nothing will happen for you outside, if you deploy negative thoughts it’s unlikely that great things are going to happen neither, just like if you are not committed in your work, i don’t see how you could expect any reward. If on the contrary you deploy lasting positive thoughts and energy in pretty much everything you do, what is the probability that great things happen to you? The odds are probably much higher than for any other person. The reason is that on an infinite line of fortunate events, the two broad parameters that come into play are the actions that you are responsible for, which i call endogenous factors and on the other side all the external or exogenous factors that colluding and connecting with the endogenous factors will generate those fortunate events.

The resulting dynamic is a ripple effect with more and more positive energy and colluding events coming as a result of the previous ones. Succeeding at doing something or overcoming a difficulty will bring great outputs that will trigger a chain of potential additional possibilities. And because you are already in the zone of those events, it’s getting easier to make them happen.

The most obvious example of it in our life is when thriving in a professional environment. People identifies outliers, those who make a difference. From there they are called when opportunities rise up around them.
