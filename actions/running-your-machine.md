# Running your machine

While business basics most of the time relate to our interactions with people and all the complexities and intricacies that come with them, running our machine is much more about our own ability to deal with ourselves and find self-efficiency.

## Dealing with pressure

It’s incredible how people are subject to putting on themselves a lot of pressure and how annihilating it can be when not coped with properly. If burning out is a consequence, handling badly and misunderstanding how to deal with pressure is certainly a devastating cause.

Let’s step back for a minute and investigate on this blocker. If you think about those moments when you felt under pressure, the symptoms were pretty much the followings: you felt alone in the corner of a room looking at the world moving forward while you were feeling kind of stuck. you felt hurt and full of shame by the impression, the feeling or even the fact that you had failed or were failing. And finally you felt powerless, like there was no visible or foreseeable solutions to the situation you were in, lost in a zone with no decent exit doors.

Alone, shameful, powerless. Those consecutive and compounded feelings can be controlled through various actions in order to fight back the pressure we put on ourselves. It’s certainly not something easy to do but most people are capable of overcoming this annihilator or blocker.

We tend to be endlessly and effortlessly capable to drag ourselves down while going back up requires much more effort. The first thing to do whenever we feel under pressure is to remember that it’s nothing else than a blocker that prevents us from moving forward. As things are piling up we should also remember that it’s never too late to release that pressure, even if we have been holding it for a long time or if it appears that the consequences of releasing it will be disastrous. The reality is that the world is not playing against us, we are mainly putting this on yourself. Let’s get to it, one symptom after another.

To fight loneliness, we must talk about it, with honesty, either to the people we love and trust or just to the people who can be able to genuinely listen to us, whether they are psychologists or even random stranger on the internet \(be careful with that though, not sure that’s such a great first idea\). Pressure is before all an inflated balloon stuck in our throat that we must learn to take out with self-honesty.

To fight the pain and the shame, we must loosen our attitude. We are flawed, we are ordinary, we are trying to deal with our life into finding some equilibrium. Failures, irreversible fatalities and unfairness rule the world in an unpredictable order. However, if some people manage to deal with the issues they’ve been hit by or thrown into, why couldn’t we ? We must stop caring so much about what people think of our state or failures and move along with our life. The more we care, the more it affects us. We must let go, imagine that we are starting all over again from scratch, cut the pain and the shame by releasing what is holding us. You spent too much money, cut the credit card. You have too many meetings, cut half of them. You feel bad at home, go walk outside. We shall never stay in a vicious circle that prevents us from moving forward. We shall just do that one thing in an attempt to move forward and break free from our ridiculous chains of pain and shame.

What about this feeling of being powerless? There are so much things to do that we don’t know where to start. We feel that we are stuck in a situation and it’s impossible to win over this state. As long as we can think, communicate and do things, everything is possible. Again, other people are succeeding in ten times worst situations, why not us? To feel in power again, we can do two actions: simply get rid of things, cleaning whatever we can in order to put our mind at ease and restart with a cleaner slate and/or do one little thing to start with and then move to the next one, with patience and resilience. When we want to practice running again, the wrong behaviour would be to put our shoes on and go for a long distance. The next day we have hardened muscles and aren’t able to run for days and the memory of our efforts will be so bad that we might likely giving up. Whatever we do, we always must develop progressive efforts and move forward with actions that are doable, repeatable and that can grow as we progress.

The reason why talking about pressure is so important is because too many people tend to mix up being pressured with being accountable. The goal of better handling our meetings, our inbox, our decisions is not to increase our workload in a given day even though productivity and efficiency matter in an organisation and in life in general, it’s to help us control our actions in order to find time for everything else without feeling that we are running behind it or out of time.

Don’t get me wrong when I praise the value of efficiency and performance, we have been pulled down for years by mediocrity and the art of going with the flow, so of course the first efforts necessary to change our average behaviour are slightly difficult and take time.

#### In practice

1. Talk honestly with your closed ones or people outside your inner professional and personal circles, whenever you feel pressured or unable to do something or move forward. 
2. Get rid of everything that is superficial or holding you down. No one can progress in a cluttered environment and nothing prevents us from cleaning up our own mess. 
3. Take one step at a time and move progressively in order to drive sustainable change and habits, otherwise you will never be able to succeed and will only put more shame on yourself.

## **Power of intensity**

Intensity is something that we naturally experience in activities sometimes but that we rarely consider to apply on how we plan and do things. The power of intensity is that the more we do something of a given nature with a defined intensity and the better we can perform this thing, up to a degree where the notion of effort disappears until we stop and regain consciousness of everything that we have just achieved. Intensity must be applied to our work environment to increase our productivity and efficiency. Let’s take a couple of examples:

#### Applied to inbox management

I receive approximately 400 emails a day, some people like Xavier Niel about 1200 onwards just to give you an idea. He manages to answer to every single one of them, by himself, pretty efficiently. I used to handle my emails as they came but not anymore except from my list of preferred recipients or regarding urgent matters.

I go through my inbox approximately twice a day, in a linear way and I apply the following rules: if an email can be read and treated in less than 30 seconds, I shall handle it. If it seems that it will take longer then I leave it in my inbox and go to the next email. After I am done dealing with the quick ones, I am looking at the number of emails in my inbox, it has obviously highly decreased which provides a satisfactory feeling. It gives me strength to now deal with the longer emails. I go through those ones and either I reply straight away and archive or I put them in my “zero” or “do it” folders, the latter meaning that I need to deal with it asap, the former meaning that I will get back to it on wednesday or sunday evening. Usually the ones that go into the zero or do it folders are the ones that I am struggling to give an immediate answer either because I need to think them through or because I need to gather more information before I can actually answer. Then on wednesday or sunday evening, I completely clean my inbox until I reach zero emails.

For most of us, inbox zero seems now like the way emails should be handled but for those who still manage their emails like they manage their text messages, here is how inbox management is done: your inbox should contain no emails once in a while. For me, it’s once a week for instance. Leaving emails in your inbox is like leaving a pending thought or action in your mind, it creates confusion and attention disorder, while the contrary creates the exact opposite effects: clarity and focus. Whenever you treat an email, you either respond and archive, forward and archive, snooze for later, archive, delete, or put it in a list with a limited number of items that will be treated within a week tops.

#### Applied to tasks

During productive phases, we mainly do two things, our inbox or our tasks. Tasks, just like emails, must be dealt with methodology. We shall be efficient in the way we do things and therefore start by dealing with the many small tasks that have piled up and that are easy to do. Then we can move forward to the longer ones that require more time and increased attention.

Whenever we start something, we shall be either time or goal constraints. The latter is when we start something that we know we shall finish before jumping into something else. For me, it’s for instance writing a blog post, going through my dealflow or cleaning up my zero-list on wednesday evening \(I don’t go to bed before I am done with it\). As for the time-sensitive matters, it’s when we know we won’t be able to finish throughout one single session or when the intensity required to achieve the tasks will be too demanding at once. For me it’s when I have to make a presentation or when I am reading for instance, I always define how long I am going to pass on a given task of this nature and stick to it.

#### In practice

1. Whether you’re dealing with your inbox or to-do list, make sure not to treat them linearly but depending on their intensity, otherwise your mind keeps jumping from one frequence to another and reach a sense of flow that allows to go throughout the day. 
2. Put clean-up times in your agenda in order to make sure that you don’t pile up too many tasks or emails that you will eventually struggle to deal with. 
3. For each action, decide whether it’s constrained by completion or time and make sure you apply the same rules depending on the type of actions.

## **Asynchronization & Distractions**

#### Dealing with distractions

The one thing that kills productivity when we perform tasks is distraction. It can come from thoughts we poorly managed to keep quiet \(and it happens, to all of us\), or from external drivers.

In regards with the thoughts that come to us and that we struggle to put away in order to stay efficient, there are only two ways to handle this situation: you can either clean house and do this thing that keeps your mind busy and prevents you from being efficient or you can use a third helper like listening to music, finding another place to work, walking while working, whatever that will keep one part of your mind busy while you work with the other. The last option, but it requires a little bit of experience and practice, is meditation.

As for dealing with external drivers, it’s pretty easy to handle them actually as you are the master of dealing with them. Set rules for people not to disturb you while you are working, it could be a sign, a little flag on your desk or the fact that you have your headphones on your ears. As for any other form of distraction which are mostly notifications, put your computer and your phone in night mode, deactivate the notifications and go check them out once every 30, 45, 60 minutes or more depending on your line of work.

Of course, it’s your responsibility to have only few applications and tabs open and not to yield to the social media temptation. Many applications exist in that field to help you deal with that. And whenever you open your social media feeds, do it in a timely manner otherwise you’ll find yourself lost into infinite scrolling and procrastination.

#### Asynchronous processing

With similar benefits as the power of intensity, dealing with our life in an asynchronous manner is a way the take the control back of our actions. Asynchronicity is the art of processing things whenever we want instead of whenever they come.

Let’s take a step back and just analyze the things that truly require immediate attention: your preferred list of contact \(boss, spouse, close friends\), customer matters, crisis, system failures, hazardous events or things that we didn’t manage on time and that absolutely require closure. Aside those things and others, if our line of job doesn’t require to react in real time, we must assess whether the opportunity to be reactive is truly valuable and useful or if we can and should delay our reaction. It allows us to be better organized for sure but also to better reflect on our actions.

The best way to process information asynchronously is to push our environment to deal with it. This is why I explicitly never answer the phone unless a call has been scheduled and most of my chatting applications are muted to avoid distractions and force asynchronous interactions.

#### In practice

1. Do not let people, notifications or anything else that is not urgent disturb you while you work. You have no excuse not to focus. Kill the notifications and let people know when it’s a good time to come see you. 
2. Do not process immediately what can be processed asynchronously, make sure you deal with the 20% of immediate/urgent matters on time and manage the remaining 80% in a timely manner. 
3. Don’t hesitate to set strict rule like not answering phone calls, uninstall facebook, instagram, snap, you name it… work in a quiet environment out of the office...etc

## **Tweaking Weaknesses**

It’s possible to debate for hours whether it’s possible or not to change people. I tend to believe that flaws and qualities are part of our characters and are somewhat absolute. And it’s their paradoxical tensions that are the source of our singularity. However, when it comes to strengths and weaknesses, the formers can be trained to improve our performance and how we do things while the latter can be tempered, tweaked and tricked in order to decrease their influences and impacts on our behaviours and actions.

One way to do a quick and relevant assessment of yourself is to take the [Assess First](https://www.assessfirst.com/) test. It is highly relevant and pretty fast to complete. From there you will be able to understand which weaknesses to address.

The best mentors will always tell you to focus on your strengths because they are the driver of your performance. It’s true, and all the best managers will make sure to take the best out of everyone to increase the whole value of the organisation instead of fighting against the weak points of each individual. However, one shouldn’t omit that our weaknesses exist and happen to express themselves in certain situations. They can even become the causes of disastrous events, putting down everything we have built so far. Therefore we must deal with them by understanding first and see afterwards how to deal with them depending on their nature and the circumstances.

The tests that you will take to detect your strengths will also help you understand your weaknesses. There are three ways to deal with your flaws, you can temper them, silent them through delegation for instance or tweak them. Depending on their nature, you can act accordingly, let’s take some examples, i’ll take mine as i know them pretty well…

I can be intolerant, impatient or distracted. Those three flaws are related to my character. I don’t want to change them as they are also the drivers of my search for excellence, efficiency and thinking. But i must acknowledge their existence and their potentially bad impact to temper them when it’s necessary \(this is when your reason helps managing your feelings and consequent actions\). For my intolerance, i reflect on my own failure to build empathy towards others. For my impatience, meditation, reading and breathing help. Against distraction, i focus on one thing at a time and have let my family know about that so they don’t get crazy when it seems that i’m not listening while i’m just lost in some thoughts.

I can also be messy, home loving. For those kind of flaws, i simply use tweaks against them. For instance, when it comes to deal with mess, I have a no paper policy. Whenever i receive a bill, a business card or anything on paper, i take a picture and throw it right away so it doesn’t stack up in a bag or a drawer. As for my tendency to stay home instead of going out, I just force myself to go out with no second guess and from there enjoy the moment. That’s an easy one.

Finally I can lack attention to details in certain situations or will stay at the surface on others. I have acknowledged that and i know that i can’t fully go against it. Also those flaws allow me to see the bigger pictures on certain things and it matters a lot in my industry. I see who i can trust either to deal with something while being careful about the details or dig into a subject accordingly, so it’s not about me doing or looking in details but identifying the persons who can do it. The people I work with at Kima Ventures always point out great details that I wouldn’t have seen and the best CEOs i work with whenever i point something that doesn’t feel right find a way to figure out thoroughly the in and out of the situation.

Find, understand and classify your weaknesses. Detect the ones you need to temper, those that you can tweak and finally the ones that require an outsider not to have to cope with them directly.

#### In practice

1. Detect your flaws and weaknesses, make sure you do it very honestly. Take a test on [Assess First](https://www.assessfirst.com/). Try to get back and understand their origin of your weaknesses as a thoughtful introspection always helps better accept who we are, it mitigates our own feeling of guilt. 
2. Then classify your weaknesses as part of your temper, of bad habits or lacks. 
3. Finally, figure out whether it should be tempered, trapped/tweaked or be delegated. Do not try to treat them all, just like anything, move step by step, thoroughly.

### **The power of routines & habits**

People forget about the importance and the power of routines and habits. Maybe because we talk so much about them. Yet, it remains one of the pillar of our life. Routines allow us to form habits and vice versa habits are formed within routines. The difference between the two elements is simple: one is linked to time, the other to action. They are the when and what of the thing we do on a regular basis.

The first time i got to understand the power of habits is when i had my first kid. Suddenly, my life was subject to the needs of my son. He was waking me up during the night or early the morning and there was no option other than taking care of him. Later on, we had to wake up early enough so our kids could be ready to go to school. I found this to be very structuring and when i finally coped with difficulties at work because i had too many emails, too many meetings or sollicitations, i remembered how incredible it had been for me to get into those routines in my personal life and therefore i started to structure my professional environment. Dealflow on monday, no meetings on wednesday, productive phase in the morning...etc all of these are routines and they help me form habits.

Retrospectively, I have been very lucky. Because i have an authority problem and feel in need for people to be proud of me, I had to introduce those routines and habits in my life not to become the slave of my agenda nor to disappoint the people I care about. I have been forced by the events, and I’m deeply grateful for that. But what about you, what would it take to start having those routines and form habits?

Well, first you shall find what motivates you to achieve things in your life and see how you can apply that to the new things that you want to strive for, you will need those lever to sustain your efforts when it becomes more challenging. Second, you need to start with something easy and that doesn’t require too much time. You can’t put too much pressure on yourself, you first need to build the satisfaction of your first accomplishments. Third, find something with consequences that can be satisfying and quickly measured. Losing weight requires too much effort in my opinion, start a new activity as well, go with something easier like waking up at the same time every day or making coffee first thing in the morning for your loved one, or doing pushups for five minutes before going to bed, something like that, you get the idea.

What you need in order to start forming a habit is of course a routine, therefore you need to set a trigger or have a reminder that won’t be disturbed by external causes, at least not for your first habits. And finally you need to find a benefit in your action, a reward and preferably something with immediate effects as you are developing your first sets of habits.

You need to keep in mind that whenever you slip, you shall not blame yourself but instead get back to it. If you want, you can keep track of your habits on a small paper or excel sheet. For bigger habits, just like for big decisions or actions, find a way to cut them in smaller pieces that will be easier to deal with. And finally but we are going to see that in the next chapter, compounded effects come from forming those habits and even though you can only measure that on the mid term, you will be amazed by the results.

#### In practice

1. Find what motivates you to achieve things. If you don’t have a driving force, you will paddle in vain and won’t find rewards. 
2. Start with a small routine that you know you can cope with. Make sure to track and measure the progress. It usually takes a couple of months to build a habit and only a couple of weeks to break it. 
3. Reward yourself either through the satisfaction of having achieved something or with something else. A pause can be a reward, a gift, or even the congratulations from someone.
