# Conclusion

Whenever I write about a subject on my blog, it’s usually to reflect on a recent experience, it’s a way for me to make myself publicly accountable towards others on a specific subject.

Human Machine is different, it’s the result of introspecting on the changes and hopefully progress that have paved my path over the past few years.

It was difficult for me just to write about it from time to time in a structured way, I felt that if I wasn’t making a bigger move, I would fall short on my expectations to deliver the right message.

I made a first attempt to write this book in November 2017 after I badly broke my right foot while playing squash. At the time, during approximately eight weeks, I managed to write every morning for a couple of hours, about half of it. Unfortunately, and for no good reasons, I broke my writing habits during winter. When I flew to the United States in April 2018, I decided that I had to finish this book.

Unfortunately I wasn’t happy with my first draft, and after several attempts, i realized that I was feeling more comfortable writing in english than in french. So I threw away my entire work and started again from scratch. For 28 days straight, I managed two schedules, early morning and late evening dealing with Europe, and all day writing and dealing with my schedule in the United States. It was intense but very rewarding as I managed to finish the first draft in time.

Then I contracted with an independent designer \(Basia Tran\) and an independent editor \(Ameesha Green\). It took me another three months to review the book entirely before Ameesha was able to review it. This is so hard to review something that you’ve done, especially for me who likes to do things and pass to the next quickly. It was a good exercise of resilience.

Now about Human Machine itself. There are three things of primordial importance that I would like to emphasize for you to reflect on this reading and the consequent actions that will follow:

The first one is that we are not perfect and that the concept of human machine is the balance of dealing with our imperfections while gaining a sense of control in our decisions and actions. You could probably read one of this book that tells you how to have a perfect day or read the interview of a young investment banker managing her life by the minute in a perfect flow of happiness and fulfillment. That’s literally ludicrous. The more constrained and controlled is your environment and the more sophisticated, transactional and cold you become. That is a simple mechanic. We become who are, we are what we do. The concept of human machine is not about building an absolute organisation, it’s about taking the full ownership of your life and relative control on your destiny.

In order to do that, and this is my second point, you need to design simple mechanics that allow you to regain control over the events of your life. It’s not about fighting towards perfection at all costs, it’s about finding a balance you love. We are not wired to make tremendous changes in our life at a very fast pace as much as it’s very difficult to overcome our own resistances to do something as a consequence of a proper thinking process. It’s a lot easier to build simple mechanical actions, coupled with positive honesty. The compounded effects of all those small actions are tremendous and this is what you are after: small steps, thoroughly put together, one after the other, with patience and a bit of resilience.

Finally, I know that this book isn’t perfect at all, that despite my genuine ambition to write something meaningful, powerful and that will help a lot of people find their equilibrium, it falls short in many aspects. But I also think that it reflects the principle of human machine as well, it’s a work in progress. That’s why I will publish updates you can track in an attempt not to reach perfection but to improve it overtime.
