# Corporate environment

I had to write a chapter about it, because most of us are evolving in corporate environments and we all know the intricacies that prevent us to thrive there with the right velocity and excellence.

Some of the people who will read the following parts will suffocate from witnessing their own experience while the others will cry from transposing themselves into those situation. Either way things must change, whether it’s within the organisation in which you are currently operating or by taking actions in order to change environment. Make a dent, or make a move, there is no steady position that will make you happy at that point. As for the managers and leaders who are actually reading this, there must be a part of them who is open to change, protecting their backyard and playing the corporate games can’t be thriving. One can’t deny that those intricacies are real in their environment, reject their negative effects, resign from doing anything to change.

But hopefully if you went that far into reading this little book, you are not ready to settle, whatever your position within the organisation, you want to be a driver for change, for yourself and by extent to others.

## Intricacies & Desolation

The aberration of most corporate environment is how so many knots have been formed everywhere within the organisation and yet for some reasons it’s still running, generating revenues and profits. It’s probably because most organisations around them are also growing this way that it limits the impacts of a mediocre execution. But we all know that unsustainable environments end up failing on the long run. Unfortunately the long run isn’t something human beings are fighting for by default. Otherwise we would respect mother nature a lot more than we poorly do.

Corporate environments are simply defined by the way they are organised in terms of hierarchy, rules of decisions and communication principles. Please don’t cry just right now, I haven’t even started, but you know exactly what I am talking about. Most organisations suffer from hierarchy insanity where managers develop in-house monarchies, where politics rule before performance. From there the way decisions are made has become a farce where people are tight to what they are told to do and can’t express their good will or creativity as it could appear as an attempt to move up the ladder and take more responsibilities, something that the current people in place can’t allow to happen, obviously.

They way hierarchy works and how decisions are made create a closed environment of communication full of complications and ambiguities in which control runs over collaboration. People are being very careful with dominant individuals whom they can’t be honest with, taking the risk of being put aside, locked or smashed. Those dominants take advantage of their situation to keep their own monarchy in place, making people fearful and silent over their power. Down the ladder, sub-managers mimic to control their own environment.

Everyone knows deep inside how wrong this is and the coffee machine has more stories to tell than all the shrinks united within an entire city, but no one moves, people just comply and go with the flow, saving what they can, doing what they are asked to do and waiting for their short evening and weekend break to enjoy the steady but apparently stable paycheck that they receive at the end of each month for enduring their job. It’s like the monarchs can’t be taken away because everytime someone attempts to change the controlled order of things, she is being shut down as an example for the other to remember that the monarch is indestructible and irreplaceable; People develop a stockholm syndrome, they become attached to their torturer. This is all ambiguous and let’s say it, totally fucked up.

## **S**olution: Rise & Raise

By now you know that you want to change the way things are, as a doer, a manager or a leader. You also know that the lower you are in the the ladder, the more people at the top will try to crush you down in an attempt to save their position and basically destroy you. That’s how insanely mad the situation is. That is why you must work towards building the right environment around your to win with patience.

The way to do this is to take in reverse the toxic environment you are in. You must be the driver that people wants to follow inside the organisation, it’s mix of behavioural change on your side and strategic move toward your colleagues and others.

First, you need to switch ambiguity and the fear to express your thoughts by positive honesty \(sounds familiar ?\) through a clear and direct approach. No more complications in the way you express and do things. Of course, not everyone will like that, but for the people with their mind and heart at the right place, they will take you as an example seeing you thrive through this approach.

From there, they will be willing to follow you but a painful consequence should follow: Your manager will deliberately shut you down and bring back the right dose of threats and fear in the room to put everyone back at their place. And people will follow this strong authoritarian arm rather than the outsider. If you can still operate in this environment, you should show the rest of your team and colleagues that this approach didn’t work on you and that you are thriving even more. From there they will see the light, they will start to see a potential leader in you, someone they want to follow the steps. Colleagues will rally your cause, you will team up and together you’ll build a much more exciting and peaceful environment.

This is the bottom up approach that allows doer to rise up within an organisation.

From the point of view of a leader or manager in a company, the approach is slightly different as you don’t need to rise up yourself and drag people with you alongside the change you are operating as an individual for the well-being of the team. You’re already in a position of power as a manager and leader, therefore you shall instead raise the people around you to embrace a new way of doing things, with more trust and honesty. This is when resources like the book “5 dysfunctions of a team” and the following episode “overcoming the 5 dysfunctions” can allow you to methodically drive the right transformation without your organisation to make long lasting moves and not short-sighted decisions

## **Never Settle**

I know that it’s a lot more complicated on a daily basis than it looks because the dominants are really strong at flipping the table and taking people down whenever they feel threatened. But your corporate environment is no different than your personal environment. No one likes the drama that sometimes come from our family environment and no one has ever highly valued destructive relationships. Eventually we are all hoping to find a better balance, to be able to communicate without pretending or having to hide behind false appearances, to love and be loved by people we respect and with whom we can exchange freely without fear.

What you are looking for in your corporate environment shouldn’t be any different than your personal one. You can’t settle before a broken situation, or someone who’re letting or driving you down. the more you wait the more you’ll pay for price and you know it already, by the time you will end this situation, you will regret not to have acted before.

Find excitement in the challenge of changing the status quo, of being in control and taking the opportunity to drive structural change that will not only help you out but also the people around that you care about.
