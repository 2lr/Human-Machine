# Better humans

## **The power of not knowing**

Did you ever notice as a child and then consequently as an adult that people are more easily willing to say “I know” or “I understand” in any given situation than the contrary, even if it’s not true? It’s because the default answer to any given question is yes, more than no. Yes is what apparently make things go smooth and easy, so we tend to genuinely acknowledge \(or ignore or escape...\) instead of figuring out if the answer should be different. It’s a vicious circle that tends to takeover our consciousness and judgement, annihilating our power of ignorance that allows us to move forward, of making deliberate choices and of saying potentially no.

How the human being works as a machine to learn is universal. Without understanding the basics of what we are trying to achieve, we can’t fully succeed. It’s the lens that provides us with clarity of vision. Moreover, understanding fuels our natural curiosity on how things work, it provides a very satisfying feeling of fulfilment. This is where starts every process of doing and achieving things the right way.

When we lack understanding, we either pretend, ignore or make the effort to start a process of learning. Pretending or ignoring is often the consequence of our incredible ability to judge people and things. It’s a fast, easy and tempting process for the mind. Whatever interactions we have in our life, we shall ask ourselves if we fully understand the nature of a situation. If we don’t, we must reflect on what would allow us to improve our understanding instead of acting with a set of information that is at best incomplete but more often inaccurate.

However, be careful not to take the notion of understanding as an absolute matter. I’ll cover in the following chapters the process of actions and decisions and you will notice that we can rarely deal with a full and accurate set of information to decide whether or not we should take one path or another. It’s about being clear about our level of understanding in order to deal with the part of uncertainty that will remain while we step forward and make calls-to-action.

When I joined the team of Pascal Mercier, my first mentor, in summer 2011, I really struggled in following some rules in the way things were done and I was afraid to speak freely and to say it. It threatened our collaboration as I was struggling to initiate the right relationship with him. After a couple of months, he understood and told me that I shouldn’t be afraid to say that I don’t know, don’t understand or don’t feel comfortable about something, that acknowledging my ignorance or incomprehension was actually a mark of strength that demonstrated awareness and honesty, that there was no weakness in asking why and how some people think or things work. This day, it hit me as an obvious lesson that I never forgot.

People sometimes fear to show their peers that they ignore or don’t understand something. Vulnerability sounds to them like a flaw instead of an opportunity to improve communication and understanding between each others. Those who lack curiosity and refuse to admit that they don’t know or understand a situation, will more likely fail to succeed compared to anyone else with a different mindset.

We are always judged by people at some point whether we like it or not, just as we are also always hard on ourselves. But this should never be a reason to quit and fake it in front of the wall of ignorance. You should ask people to offer your their hands. People value honesty and are willing to help, often more than you think. Acknowledging our lack of understanding or ignorance is a sign of maturity, it allows us to face our true self, something we should never be afraid of. Fear will never help you make a move, it will always stop you, and frequently at times when you should actually be moving forward.

## **Reasoning our emotions**

Around the notion of understanding, there is a whole process of receiving and treating information. We don’t pay much attention about the flow in our mind but one philosopher, Baruch Spinoza, passed his entire existence linking the reason to the emotions and it’s pretty revealing on how we behave as human beings and how we can improve the way we interact through the events in our life. It’s part of the foundations that allow us to make the most out of our interactions with the world in general.

Our mind functions with two gears, one automatic and one manual. You will often hear people talk about system 1 and system 2. It’s explained in details in the book Thinking, fast and slow.

The automatic gear or system 1 is our intuitive, emotional, simple mode of thinking, it’s how we initially process everything. It’s triggered by our experience, knowledge or feeling. Everything that relies to a pattern of recognition or sounds obvious to us will be identified as true by our system 1. And this is the tricky part of our machine as we might sometimes pass the test of our own system while failing at being actually right about something. Let’s take for instance the milk and white association. You ask people what color is the milk, they say white, then you ask them what do we drink in the morning with cereals and they will naturally answer milk, from what cheese is made, what do babies drink, what do baby animals drink. They will keep saying Milk, And then you ask what does a cow drink, most of the people will spontaneously answer milk… While it’s water of course. They’ve been tricked by their own mind, system 1 is autonomously running, while the system 2 which is supposed to help them resonate is shutdown, the full mental bandwidth being already used.

The manual gear or system 2, however, is a more deliberate, reasoned, complex mode of thinking. It’s how we can provide a second opinion or second thought and solve more effortful operations. Part of the job of our conscious mind is to help control our unconscious in order to improve the quality of our reflex, of our intuition, of our mindset in general. The system 2 is the training center of our system 1 and the more we link them together, the better we behave and react to certain events. Anger, susceptibility, sadness, impatience, intolerance and so forth are automatic feelings that can be tweaked through an appropriate, thoughtful and patient action of our manual gear.

This being said and understood, let’s see how it relies to our reason and our emotions together and why it’s so important to successfully master this loop.

![A+B = Open Mindedness, C+D = Understanding, E+F = Willingness](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2812%29.png)

Emotions are the first ever reaction to any particular event, whether it makes us laugh, uncomfortable, cry, scream… It’s our most primitive reaction. From there comes an association to feelings, we are able to interpret how we feel, whether it’s sad, happy, disappointed… and finally comes the most complex part that requires our full intention, it’s our reason, the process of explaining how we feel but most importantly why. This is where starts the process of aligning our emotions to our reason. Dealing with our reason in an appropriate way is all about putting together open-mindedness, understanding and willingness.

Open-mindedness is our ability to start a clean thoughtful process by acknowledging that we might be wrong about something and that we are open to discover something new or another truth about a given situation. The best way to put ourselves in a state of open-mindedness is to think about past events where we remembered being wrong and in which we valued the new perspective gained from this lost argument. It helps us find the state of mind in which you were at the time.

Then, we must start a process of understanding. Being open just allows you to release your good faith and unlock all the barriers of your cerebral cortex. Now you must process the information. In any given situation, there is a rationale and an irrational part, the latter being the natural extent of our feelings and emotions, linked to particular events. In both cases, our job is to successfully explain, in a very simple and straightforward way why and how the flow of the events took a particular path. From there we must reflect on what would it take to generate another output, the best possible one. It came come from our own actions and the way we handle a situation or on the contrary from someone else and therefore how we can invite this person to change her behaviour.

Now comes willingness, our ability not only to understand a situation but to drive change whether it’s in its actual form regarding which actions to take or how we feel about something. In the latter, we are reversing the process from our reason to our emotions to control ourselves, keep our head clear and find a balance in the way the feel about any given situation. And there is no limit in our ability to reflect on things in order to change how we process them. The more balanced and in control we feel the better we are able to deal with any situation.

I was attending a meeting with an entrepreneur and an advisor. At one point during the meeting, the advisor told the entrepreneurs that he should run his company in a certain way. My immediate emotion was anger, i was feeling mad at this person. Phase A & B. The reason is that she was pushing the entrepreneur into one direction without reflecting properly on the current situation of the company nor explaining why it should be operating this way rather than another. I quickly understood that I had to calm my nerves if I wanted to bring a constructive approach and flip the table. This person wasn’t ill-intentioned, she was just throwing things from her strong belief or past experience. It wasn’t misconduct, just clumsiness. I knew I should remain calm if I wanted this situation to evolve. I was in phase C & D. So i did calm my emotions and resynched them with my reason. From there I explained calmly but firmly that this remark was unsolicited and needed thorough explanations so that the entrepreneur could understand why and how the advisor was approaching this issue and whether or not it would make sense for him to follow this advice. Phase E & F.

The example above is about stepping back and settle down in order to react appropriately to a certain situation. The goal is simply to generate the best possible outcome, which is very straightforward. However, when it comes to drive more substantial changes in our life, finding the motivation to act requires to understand, enable and repeat the triggers and conditions that drove out past improvements.

## Triggers & conditions

We are nothing short of being the masters when it comes to resist to efforts and changes. People even wrote entire books about all the reasons why we don’t do things, like the War of art, a succession of pages on how resistance applies to everything we do. Well, as much as this is true, there is always a way to actually move forward. The people who succeed have all found consciously or not the triggers, motives or reasons to do things.

It can vary in terms of nature and intensity but there is always one, it can be the fear of failing, the will to please, the search for pleasure, the need of balance, the competitiveness, the non acceptance of weakness, the struggle with authority, or even self-motivation to learn and progress. Here are three examples that i like to take and that were triggered for different reasons.

I smoked one pack a day for about 10 years, and then I discovered this book “The easy way to stop smoking” by Allen Carr. I had heard that it worked incredibly well so I read and it did ! Forty eight hours after, I had quit without missing a puff of that crap. One thing that resonated with me was what he called the “Nicotine Monster”, this beast inside you that is winning and beating you up from the inside, always asking for one more cigarette. I’ve always had an issue with authority, it makes me feel like i’m unwindly trapped into something. Therefore the personification of the act of smoking appealed to me immediately, i was feeling ridiculously trapped and it didn’t take me long to just stop.

On another note, I had a two days personal reflection training with a coach in 2017. At the end of the two days, this person advised me to read a book, the spinoza problem. He told me that i would probably like it and that it would be great to talk about it when we meet again the next time. I’ve probably read less than a dozen book in my entire life, i’ve never been an avid reader, and i’m not proud of it don’t get me wrong, but it just never hit me. Anyway, i didn’t want to disappoint him, i wanted him to be proud, just like I want my family, my friends, or my boss to be proud of me. So i bought the book and started reading it. It helped me reflect on a lot of things but also fuel one of my weaknesses: lack of patience. Reading forces my patience and it’s good for me. Also, because i found something valuable into this book, i started to like the action of reading. From this day on, i’ve been reading close to three or four books every single month.

Finally, about how i became highly productive in almost everything i do. In 2015, I joined Kima Ventures, the venture capital arm fo Xavier Niel, France most respected entrepreneurs. It was a dream come true to have the chance to work closely with him. Very quickly, my inbox, my agenda and my dealflow were all overwhelming. My organisation had taken the control over me, it was the authority ;\) As I couldn’t take it anymore and strongly wanted to make an impression on my boss so we could envision an ambitious future together, I decided to take the control back and from there started the transformation of my organisation. I had always been efficient and synthetic, but now with a neat organisation and clear rules, i had become super productive.

In those cases, two major things appear, my reluctance to authority and my search for pride from others. There are always one or several triggers that drive the major shifts that happen in our lives and they are always linked to certain conditions. When I stopped smoking, it was an opportunity that i took and through the reading i came to realize how stupid i was. When i went to this coach, i willingly wanted to reach another step in my personal journey and i was struggling to find how and through this process a couple of things unlocked but my major learning came from starting to read. When I joined Kima Ventures, i was forced into the change of pace and it forced me to drive that change in order to cope with the events.

You should always look back and detect both the conditions and the triggers of what you achieved in your life. Sometimes you’ll be able to mimic the events in order to make things happen, sometimes they will come to you accidentally, just be ready and open to it.

At a minor level, triggers become tweaks that we can use to trap our weaknesses and fight against the small resistances of our daily life. But i’ll get back to that later.

**Key Takeaways:** I like the idea of us becoming better humans as time goes by. And I hope that you do too. To openly acknowledge our lacks and gaps allows us to get into a thoughtful process of understanding. From there we are able to gain a sense of control over our emotions through reflection and reasoning. It gives us the necessary mindset to act accordingly in most situations in which we would have rushed or missed the mark otherwise. The final step into becoming a better person is to drive sustainable progress either by replicating the right conditions or by being open to the opportunities, in which we can trigger the right changes in our lives.

* I understand the importance of making deliberate choices
* I understand the power of not knowing and acknowledging it
* I understand the link between reason and emotion
* I understand clearly Open-mindedness, Understanding and Willingness
* I understand that reflection is key towards a better behaviour
* I understand that every change happens in certain conditions with clear triggers
* I understand that conditions and triggers can be repeated to drive change

What appears to be mechanical needs to be supported by the right mindset. You can’t become a better human without becoming a better person.
