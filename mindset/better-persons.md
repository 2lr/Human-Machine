## Positive honesty by default

I know, this sounds ridiculously obvious. Your parents told you that already, your religion taught you this as well \(if you are a believer\) and you’ve probably been the witness of karma. But this is far more important than you have probably acknowledged it until today and that’s why i wanted to insist on how being nice and honest play a major role in the future that lies ahead of you.

Positive Honesty is a magic combo where positivity is a mindset to win by default because your attitude will make you thrive as a human being and honesty is a driver of long term performance as it’s the most noble and lasting way to approach and do things in general.

Let’s start with a simple mechanism, smiling, something that you can easily practice without too much effort. You will probably tell yourself that you are already smiling most of the time, and that’s probably true, but try to smile when you are concentrating on something, when you are in a business meeting, when the events are not naturally putting you in this state. Studies show that people who constantly smile, even with a stick in their mouth in order to force them to do so, over-perform in any given task compared to people who don’t. It’s a two ways system. If we feel happy, we produce endorphins and a signal to our facial muscles, triggering a smile. The opposite is true. If we activate our facial muscles and smile, we send a signal to our brain, stimulating our reward system and therefore producing endorphins. Endorphins help reduce stress and is a natural booster of activity and efficiency.

If you couple that with honesty, it helps you balance a relative state of euphoria with clarity of vision. As endorphin reduces stress, it also maximizes optimism. The issue with this state of flow that helps you cope with any situation, it’s that it partly disables your ability to honestly question and analyse clearly a given situation. The same mechanism appears with anger. Our relatively extreme feelings annihilate our reasoning. That is why it’s fundamental to make sure that our optimism is balanced with clairvoyance and honesty as it’s how we keep our feet down to earth while having our head up high. Whenever you are thinking or acting, ask yourself if you release enough positive energy and remember that smiling is a natural enabler. At the same time, make sure that you are fully aware of the totality, reality, and complexity of the situation you are in.

Positive, honest thinking will have three impacts in your life: It is an enabler of possibilities, your mind being in peace, it will allow you to see things with a more open perspective. The second effect is that it paints a pattern of eagerness in situations and spreads to people in those situations. Finally, positivity is glowing, people see it from the outside, it’s a magnet that attracts opportunities \(with its fair dose of noise as well, of course\).

On the contrary, negativity partly disables your ability to see things clearly or with a broad view. It’s also a tenser of situations, and a blocker of external opportunities at best, and spreads like a plague at worst. Why would anyone nurture a negative attitude?

Here is an example that we have all faced. You went to a restaurant and that day the waiter was in a bad mood. Maybe he had an argument with a friend, his colleague was sick and left him with too much work to do, or some uneducated customers gave him a really hard time. When the waiter came to you, he wasn’t very pleasant, you might argue that it’s not a way to treat customers and that’s true. But what if instead of hitting him back you were behaving with an opposite attitude, being patient, smiling at him and talking nicely? the natural reaction that will be triggered most of the time is that your smile will translate to his own behaviour as people mimic what they like, the probability that he smiles back at you and treat you greatly will be higher. Of course, you’ll have to bear with him and the current situation, maybe accept that he’s in a rush, but your mutual understanding of the situation will allow you to enjoy your meal. The opposite is true, if you don’t acknowledge the difficulty of the situation for him and treat him badly, you’ll have a bad experience and ultimately this is not what you want. You’d better leave the place instead. It’s your power of understanding, and your ability to reason your emotion that will allow you to assess any given situation and act accordingly with a positive honest mindset to make the most out of a situation and generate the best potential output.

## **Clear up you mind**

As systems 1 and 2 go, our mental bandwidth is limited and constraint. However, we can stretch them a little by working on our cognitive abilities through meditation and brain exercises.

Meditation and brain exercises are either relaxing or fun, they come with their dose of gamification and neat user experience that we are now used to on our smartphones. They don’t even require to take a lot of time, less than 5 to 10 minutes per session is enough to start meditate or train your brain, it’s one of those steps that are easy to take when we are in search for improvements in our life. As usual, the most difficult part of recurring events is to form a habit, but I’ll get back to that later.

To train your brain, you can try apps such as Luminosity, Peak or Elevate. To meditate, I especially like Headspace, it comes with different categories such as Productivity, Health and of course Foundation. Meditation is one of the way to fuel our open-mindedness, patience and tolerance, it can be a great enabler. You should give it a try or get back to it if you had tried but given up in the past.

To develop the abilities of your mind don’t prevent you from managing how much information you are putting into it. Most people don’t realize how easily we can overwhelm ourselves by storing too much information without processing them, and it doesn’t matter whether they are active or pending tasks, as long as it’s in our mind, it’s using bandwidth. In order to sort this out, think of your mind as a box with three compartments. The routines, the active actions and the scheduled tasks. Each one of those boxes has its function.

Routines are everything that you do on a pretty much regular basis and that you know is coming at some point. The goal of routines is to avoid too much overwhelming about certain tasks by knowing when they will be performed. For me, it’s going down my inbox to reach zero emails two times a week on wednesday and sunday, it’s achieving whatever actions that is in my to-do list called zero every sunday night, it’s going through our deal-flow every monday. It’s not because routines exist that they must be absolutely respected at all times but whenever we slip, we must get right back to a state where the routines end up being dealt with. With routines come automatisms, the things that we have decided to deal with in a systematic way, like not answering the phone unless the call is programmed, replying to messages only in the evening, having a simple wardrobe to avoid too much thinking when we dress up in the morning, never drink alcohol during the week, etcetera.

Then, there are the active actions, it’s everything that is either quick to deal with and put behind or immediate \(as urgent or forced\). Whenever i can do something that takes few minutes only, I just do it right away. If it takes more than few minutes or if i lack time, it goes into my todo list called Zero to be dealt with later. If it’s something urgent, I either treat it right away, or put it in a list called Forward, in order to treat it later during the day or first things in the morning the next day, at the same time as other important matters.

Those Zero and Forward lists are the scheduled actions which are all the tasks or things i have thought about that came my way and that I have decided to treat another time. I admit that I also have a list called “one day” which looks more like a bucket list of things that I should probably do one day… But no comment on that ;\)

All those tasks, whether we talk about the routines, the active actions or the scheduled ones need to be properly classified so that our brain is only concentrated on one thing at a time, often the active tasks, because we know that the two other categories are handled by the way we have organized them.

Our mind is a calculator which limits are quickly reached, therefore you must pay attention to what you put into those lists and routines. If you send your boyfriend or girlfriend to the grocery store and ask them to buy cucumber, potatoes, carrots, butter, yogurts, parmesan, biscuits, bread and water, there is a high probability that one of the item will be lost along the way or that the person will struggle to recompose the list in her mind. Up to seven, our memory works just fine, above that number, It starts to rumble. However, if you put them into categories and that on top of that you limit each category to 3 items, it will be way easier for the person to remember them. Tell her milky products: yogurts, parmesan, milk, then vegetables: carrot, cucumber, potatoes, then others: biscuits, bread and water. Even though the last list is not accurate, because the person knows that 3 items are on that list, she will remember the three items in each of the 3 lists.

Be careful, don’t have too many lists and don’t put too many things into them, i try to limit them to 7 items. If they’re full it either means that they are not dealt with, which means that we are probably disorganized or that we are unable to delegate or simply say no. In both cases, it’s bad because it overwhelms our mind and therefore our ability to move forward in a peaceful and efficient way.

## **Find yourself**

Do you remember that day when your parents told you that you could succeed in everything in life as long as you loved what you were doing? Most of us took this the wrong way by assuming that what we love we do it well. Unfortunately it’s a wrong statement. I love to cook but i’ll never be a great cook, I love to draw but my son asks me why he’s better than me when it comes to painting \(that tells a lot\), I love to dance but I’m wondering why I can’t move like that guy which movements seem to be plugged straight to the instruments… We don’t necessarily do well what we’d love to, but we tend to love what we do well, and this is a big difference in the way we approach things.

I’ve always been an introvert. My sister even told me once that I was ignoring my asperger disorder. The truth is that i’m probably on the edge of it… Being shy made me an observer, a listener, someone who learns more about people that they actually understand about themselves sometimes. It fuels empathy and altruism. As I grew up, I’ve learnt to appreciate the other traits that define me as a person and noticed how paradoxal some of them were: Even though I’m an introvert, i’m a good salesman, but it’s because i understand people well that i can sell well. It’s all connected. I’m also good at synthesising \(maybe because i don’t like to talk much\), I am efficient \(Probably a result of my laziness\), I lack patience and tolerance but at the same time i like to contemplate things \(which makes me slow\) and I do tons of mistakes and typo errors.  


I’ve been lucky in the way events turned for me. I’ve always been a bit of a duffer, i repeated grades in high school and then again at university, I’ve started a lot of things but finished only few. When i was 25, as i was trying to build a career as an investment banker in a small ipo and fundraising boutique, lehman brothers collapsed and the financial crisis hit hard. I hadn’t even started my professional career per se that i was screwed… So I figured I should probably launch my own boutique, at least to own my fate in this industry. From there I navigated, understanding what I was good at and pushing every opportunity I had to thrive where my talents were needed. Eventually, I joined the dream partner for a dream job, as one of xavier niel’s trusted guy to invest in startups. And the lesson here is pretty obvious: we don't necessarily do well what we seem to like or love. We actually excel at misguiding ourselves through mis-reasoned feelings, thinking that finding what we love will help us find what to do. It’s actually the opposite, we’ll always end up loving what we do incredibly well. That’s why we shall reverse-engineer ourselves to list our talents and soft skills, to find where and how we can put them at work.

What a great product marketer, salesman, customer success, carpenter, plumber, electrician, look like? It’s not much about what they know, it’s about the talents that they have and that allowed them to thrive into learning what they now know and making them great at what they do. What does it take to be a great doer, manager or leader? Do we have what it takes, are we comfortable into moving up the ladder or shall we preserve our talents and express them horizontally in a different position, at a different scale or even in a different company. To define who we are and where we can thrive as an individual, we must reflect on our personality. Tests are a great way to begin this journey of understanding our abilities, the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator being the most common one. Don’t hesitate to repeat those test several time and every six months as our answers tend to change. It will allow you to put the right words in front of your talents and abilities and from there to navigate into the intricacies of your career.

From there you should define what kind of role and career you should aim for. But in the meantime, i’d like you to do another type of exercise, what i call the enabling paradoxes. In the studies of the systems 1 and 2, people have demonstrated that we shall preferably start by talking about the cons of a situation rather than the pros as the latters are naturally decreasing our ability to list the formers. Finding the flaws that define our characters and temper allows us to identify our strengths and qualities. Life is not about flat attributes that pile up to define who we are but about the tension brought by the paradoxes of our character.

I am a lazy, shy, intolerant, impatient, messy, easily bored, unwilling to face authority kind of person. All those flaws could be used against me, my productivity, my relationship with others. But, in fact, they also trigger incredible abilities.

Being lazy means that I always look for a shorter and simpler way to do things, it’s what drive efficiency and search for productivity in my life. Being shy means that i’m an introvert, i listen more than i talk, i look at signals, i observe. It helps me develop my empathy, my sense of others, my ability to understand situations where people would naturally jump into short-sighted conclusions. Being kind of intolerant makes me demanding, with myself and others, it’s a search for excellence. Being impatient drives performance as i like things to be achieved quickly. Being messy means that the more I have, the less it’s organized, therefore i put everything behind me whenever i can and i try not to store, keep or accumulate things otherwise i know it will be untidy. Being easily bored makes me focus on the instant quality of events, i maximize the moments i live in, and i don’t bother myself with things i don’t like.

The overall goal of listing all your flaws is to know yourself better and acknowledge where you are vulnerable. Then you shall use those vulnerabilities to express their paradoxical benefits that will help you thrive as a good person. The more you can make a good use of them, the better you will accept them and avoid to reject or deny their existence.

**Key Takeaways:** It doesn’t take much time and efforts to drive progress and meaningful changes in our life. It all starts with having a positive and honest mindset in every thought we develop and every action we take. From there we simply deploy positive inputs towards attracting positive attitudes and delivering positive outcomes. But that is only possible with a clear way of doing things through the right routines, rules and organisation in general. And it can only serves our self development if it’s in connection with things we do well and that we deeply appreciate. That’s why it’s important to reflect on our set of attributes to determine their positive and negative outputs and how we can benefit from them in the career that we decide to pursue.

* I understand the balance between positivity and honesty
* I understand the value of a clear mind
* I understand the difference between routines, active actions, and scheduled tasks
* I understand that I can’t pile up infinite list of items
* I understand the value of loving what I do well, and not the opposite
* I understand the notion of paradoxical tensions of character
