## Put the pressure down

The promise of all the resources about self-help or self-development is to allow us to better know ourselves towards finding our next best version as happy human beings. Unfortunately for the majority of us, we never manage to become this person. There are simple reasons for this commonly known failure.

The habits of the most successful people, the best recipes from the most renowned chefs, the miracle methods to lose weight, to sleep better or to become more productive, they are all great stories to tell. They sound obvious, brilliant, yet so simple. Therefore we project ourselves like in a movie, our hope that everything can change for the better tomorrow is at its all high, just like our apparent motivation. Nothing could stop us from achieving greatness. We get ourselves transported into an imaginary future in which we accomplish extraordinary things. It does feel like when people play the lottery and imagine what they could do with all that money if they win.

It’s a candid illusion.

Then we face the truth, like a boomerang. It’s not the right time, we don’t have all the ingredients, it’s not really something for us, we have better things to do, we don’t see the results of our actions, it’s too painful, too difficult or it simply doesn’t work. There is an endless list of excuses to explain our lack of accomplishments, but they really bring us no further forward at the end of the day. Even worst, they trigger our natural defence mechanism where emotions follow one another until we accept our fate. Denial, culpability, anger, rejection, unhappiness, and then silent acceptance. We are just waiting for the next projection of our imaginary super-self.

Psychologists have demonstrated that the most powerful personal transformations usually come from traumatic, impactful events, which is not something we should wish for. We can’t just let things go until we hit bottom or that something significant enough happen in our life. Fatalism or waiting for an epiphany isn’t the best way to lead any self development or transformation.

On another related note, we need to get rid of all the speeches about operating hard changes or making big bold moves that will transform our life for good. It’s a complete trumpery, another future disenchantment that we can only suffer from.

The reality about self-development is honestly less brutal and a lot more hopeful in my opinion, so let me make it easy for you: Your situation isn’t binary, there is no such things as a super-self or a self-loser, it’s not a fierce battle between burgers versus quinoa, yoga versus nap, or netflix versus book, productivity versus procrastination. There is nothing absolute into finding happiness, it’s all about finding and maintaining the right balance while we keep moving forward with our life.

In order to do that, we are going to put aside the boomerang of your incredible imaginary self, to get rid of all signs of culpability about all the things that we haven’t done yet or the unproductive things that we are probably going to do today \(chatting, watching a movie, attending a boring meeting…\). No one has ever accomplished extraordinary things overnight. The human being is a machine, singular, paradoxal and complex for sure, but for whom each achievement or accomplishment is just the compound result, more or less organized, of pretty simple things. But before we get to those things, let’s set a couple a rules between us.

## **Commit with trust and patience.**

There is no losers, just bad or overwhelmed teachers.  
There is no quitters, just incompetent or mistrained managers.

People who are already up on the ladder, who have knowledge and experience on certain matters, whose responsibility is to show the way and be an example for their peers, they must take the ownership for those who fail under and around them. This is my responsibility towards you as well.

The conditions are obviously not ideal, we don’t have a mutual agreement, I haven’t chosen the readers and you can’t initially assess the value of this book besides what you have heard about it. There is not active interactivity between us but believe me when I say that I deeply and honestly care about having an impact on what’s coming next in your life. I don’t care about the number of words that this book carries along, I just want it to be substantial, authentic and actionable.

My intention is to help you find your way toward the next best version of yourself and it all starts from you with commitment, through trust and patience. No efforts, just attention and good intentions as a start. Again, Trust and patience.

Trust because the best understandings of all things start with the initial intention to believe in them. You can’t be defiant of what I am about to reveal. You’ll reflect on a number of assertions and arguments afterwards and you probably won’t agree with everything, but in the meantime I really need you to maximize your natural receptiveness.

Patience because you need to activate tolerance. Actions with sustainable consequences take time, you’ll have to content yourself with small victories before you can really enjoy notable  changes in your life.

Shall we give it a try? :\)

## Equilibrium & growth

Self-development is a generic term, just like artificial intelligence in tech or diet in nutrition. The issue with any universal concept is that it kills the inherent substance of the core subject it’s supposed to be attached to. Popularization is great for democratization but disastrous for true meanings. We lose consciousness and understanding of the matters we are supposed to be aware of.

We shall get back to the heart of what we are truly looking for in our life if we want to be able to move forward. And it certainly doesn’t have to be complex or complicated. We are all searching for a fulfilling sensation in who we are and what we are doing, it’s as simple as that. What we need in order to experience this feeling of realisation is to get into a state of relative equilibrium, and a movement of growth, both those constants being synchronized, each one of them fueling the other and moving together with compounded effects.

Finding an equilibrium is not about getting into a steady or perfect state, it’s just impossible, it’s about balancing in one way or another while understanding where we stand and feeling in control of what’s happening in our life. This is what allows us to be in peace with ourselves as an imperfect human being and also more importantly to initiate this movement of growth.

It’s like when you’re in the park with your kids or having a good time with your friends even though you know that you have other things to do as well, related to your home or your work for instance. You can’t do everything at the same time, and you are probably late or behind schedule for some of them. Like right now, while you are reading this book, you could probably tackle a couple of things that are long due in your to-do list. Relax, you will handle them eventually, just don’t rush into it.  

We need to accept who we are and where we stand right now, with all the things that are going right but more importantly with everything that are falling apart because we can’t solve everything at once and we won’t. This is where our equilibrium starts and don’t worry it will grow on you as things get slightly better within days, weeks, months or even years.

Imperfections are part of us, it’s about being aware of them that matter. It’s not because we have rules and obligations that we perfectly comply with them. I shall empty my inbox two times a week, take meetings only from 2pm to 5.30pm and be reading a good book before going to bed instead of watching TV Series. Yet you can’t imagine how many times I break those rules in a given week. But because I have them, I know where I stand when I slip from my schedule, it allows me to keep a relative sense of control and find a healthy balance that fits with my inspirations. Awareness is key.

As for growth, it’s in our nature. Since our childhood, we have been programmed to learn, execute and progress and there is no reason why we should stop when becoming adults.

There isn’t a better satisfaction than reaching out to something that feels right and good to us. Every smart move that we make contribute to this feeling of realisation. It’s in every decision and action that we take: holding a door, smiling at someone, helping out, cleaning up, or simply doing something that we are supposed to do. And for each move that we make, it’s either a reinforcement of what we already know, a learning/discovery or a change/adaptation in something that’s not at the right place.

The pressure is down, you are committed with trust and patience, and you understand that you are not asked to accomplish something extraordinary or impossible, it’s just about finding a balanced state and keeping the movement going.

Now we can start addressing all the blockers and enablers that will allow you to thrive as a person.

Key Takeaways: You are about to operate some changes in your life, with open-mindedness, commitment and understanding of what you are going after. It is not going to be brutal or sudden, it’s going to be subtle, to take time and therefore will require that you don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Commit with good intentions, accept your imperfections and the state of where the things currently are. From there you’ll find a relative equilibrium that will grow on you as your move forward.
